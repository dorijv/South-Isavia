# Isavia - South #

Summer of 2022 I worked as Airport Security in KeflavÃ­k, Iceland. One of our routine assignments was configuring the gates for Schengen / Non-Schengen zones.

I made this small application to make the process easier for my shift.

* Flights/Gates are listed in ascending order by time
* Marked flights are centralized, that is if one person marks a flight,
  it will be marked for everyone else.
